TASK_2:  
To run the tests it is needed to manually accept the cookies by pressing the 'Agree to all' button on the browser as selenium canÂ´t find the button on the cookies banner (in the shadow-root).  
It was created a feature file containing the scenario under test and a steps definition file for the implementation of each step of the scenario. A SearchPage class was also created to keep the locators and methods of that page (page object model).  
It was created a TestRunner based on TestNG which allow us to run the tests from the terminal and generates a HTML report (under 'target' folder).  

NOTES: It was really dificult to build these tests as the pages under tests were highly fleky and the DOM component was really hard to deal with (sometimes almost impossible to manage web elements with selenium).
